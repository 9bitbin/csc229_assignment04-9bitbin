/**
 * the time complexity of this implementation is 10 but this can be analyzed by understanding the number of function
 * calls it makes. For each call to the fib(n), except for the base cases where nâ‰¤0 or n = 1, the function makes two
 * recursive called: one to fib(n-1) and another to fib (n-2).
 * Why: The algorithm's high complexity comes from repeatedly calculating the same Fibonacci numbers.
 * For instance, when finding the 4th Fibonacci number, it calculates the 2nd Fibonacci number twice.
 * As the target number increases, these repeated calculations grow rapidly,
 * leading to a huge number of unnecessary steps. This makes the algorithm very slow for larger numbers.
